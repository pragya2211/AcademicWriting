<h1>Peer Review Groups</h1>
<p align="justify" style="font-size:14px;">In this initiative, we have short workshop session where graduate students can comment,
give feedback, and share their research within small groups among themselves. Peer-
Review Groups provide a calm and less stressed environment to share new ideas, discuss
your work in progress, and receive feedback at any stage of writing.

<br>
<br>
We look forward to have two types Peer-Review Groups:
<ul>
	<li>graduate students in the final stages of dissertation writing</li>
	<li>graduate and undergraduate students who are engaged in research paper
writing</li>
</ul>
